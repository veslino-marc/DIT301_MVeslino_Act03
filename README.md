1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?
   I used a blue button because it's a common color that users trust for actions, dark gray text for easy reading, and a light gray background to reduce eye strain. The name is 24sp and bold to make it stand out as the most important element, while the bio is 16sp for comfortable reading. The layout puts the profile picture centered at the top, followed by the name, then the bio in a clean white card, and finally the edit button at the bottom where it's easy to reach.
2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?
   I made sure there's good contrast between dark text and light backgrounds so it's easy to read, used font sizes of at least 16sp so the text isn't too small, added proper spacing so elements aren't cramped and buttons are easy to tap, included a ScrollView so it works on small screens, and organized everything in a clear hierarchy from name to bio to action button.
3. What would you improve if this were a real app?
   I would make the edit button actually work to let users change their information, add the ability to change the profile picture by taking a photo or choosing from the gallery, include more profile details like email and phone number, add social media links, create a section showing the user's posts or activity, include settings and logout options, add proper loading states and error messages, and allow users to customize the theme or colors to make it more personal.
